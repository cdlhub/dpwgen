# dpwgen

Diceware passphrase generator command line tool written in Go. It generates "random" passphrase from a wordlist file based on EFF article [Deep Dive: EFF's New Wordlists for Random Passphrases](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases).

## Prerequisites

* Go language: Follow installation steps at Golang documentation [Getting started](https://golang.org/doc/install) page.

## Installation

Use Go tool to install `dpwgen` executable on any platform (Linux, macOS, or Windows):

```sh
go get -v github.com/cdlhub/dpwgen
```

Or, build executable from sources:

1. Use `git` to download sources:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cdlhub/dpwgen.git
    ```

1. Build the package:

    ```sh
    cd dpwgen
    go build
    ```

## Usage

You need a diceware wordlist file as described in [Deep Dive: EFF's New Wordlists for Random Passphrases](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases). Two EFF files are provided in the repository:

* [eff_large_wordlist.txt](eff_large_wordlist.txt).
* [eff_short_wordlist_2_0.txt](eff_short_wordlist_2_0.txt).

The number of dice the tool needs to throw is automatically detected from the file format.

You can then generate a passphrase with the number of words you want (e.g. 6):

```sh
$ dpwgen -n 6 eff_large_wordlist.txt
whiff surname footgear overfill bust expel
```

If you don't provide a word list file, it will use an embeded version of `eff_short_wordlist_2_0.txt`:

```txt
$ dpwgen -n 3
dig showroom septum
```

Use `-help` to display usage:

```sh
$ dpwgen -help
Usage:
        dpwgen -version
        dpwgen [ -n N ] <pass-file-name> 

  -n uint
        number of words in generated password (default 4)
  -version
        Print version number
```

## Tests

Run unit tests from the repository directory:

```sh
go test -v ./...
```
